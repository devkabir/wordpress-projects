# WP Vue.JS boilerplate for plugin developers

Plugins are packages of code that extend the core functionality of WordPress. JQuery is very popular with WordPress developers for creating unique, dynamic, and engaging websites. Instead of using jQuery we will use vue.js

## Why Vue.js ??

Vue is suitable for small projects where you just want to add a little bit of reactivity, submit a form with AJAX, show the user a modal, display the value of an input as the user is typing, or many other similarly straightforward things. Itâ€™s scalable and also fantastic for huge project.

## Steps

- clone this repo and move to `wp-content/plugins`.
- rename folder and file name.
- update header according to your need.
- add shortcode `[wp-vue]` to any page or post
- activate plugin and check in front.
